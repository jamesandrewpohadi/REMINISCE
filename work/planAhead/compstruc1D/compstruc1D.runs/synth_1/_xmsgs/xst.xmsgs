<msg type="info" file="Xst" num="741" delta="new" >HDL ADVISOR - A <arg fmt="%d" index="1">4</arg>-bit shift register was found for signal &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="2">reset_cond/M_stage_q_3</arg>&gt; and currently occupies <arg fmt="%d" index="3">4</arg> logic cells (<arg fmt="%d" index="4">2</arg> slices). Removing the set/reset logic would take advantage of SRL<arg fmt="%d" index="5">32</arg> (and derived) primitives and reduce this to 1 logic cells (1 slices). Evaluate if the set/reset can be removed for this simple shift register. The majority of simple pipeline structures do not need to be set/reset operationally.
