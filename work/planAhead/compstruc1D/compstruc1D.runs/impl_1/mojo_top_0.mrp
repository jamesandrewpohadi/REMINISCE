Problem encountered during the packing phase.

Design Summary
--------------
Number of errors   :   2
Number of warnings :   6

Section 1 - Errors
------------------
ERROR:Pack:2309 - Too many bonded comps of type "IOB" found to fit this device.
ERROR:Map:237 - The design is too large to fit the device.  Please check the Design Summary section to see which resource requirement for
   your design exceeds the resources available in the device. Note that the number of slices reported may not be reflected accurately as
   their packing might not have been completed.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:MapLib:701 - Signal spi_channel[3] connected to top level port
   spi_channel(3) has been removed.
WARNING:MapLib:701 - Signal spi_channel[2] connected to top level port
   spi_channel(2) has been removed.
WARNING:MapLib:701 - Signal spi_channel[1] connected to top level port
   spi_channel(1) has been removed.
WARNING:MapLib:701 - Signal spi_channel[0] connected to top level port
   spi_channel(0) has been removed.
WARNING:MapLib:701 - Signal spi_miso connected to top level port spi_miso has
   been removed.
WARNING:MapLib:701 - Signal avr_rx connected to top level port avr_rx has been
   removed.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:Map:284 - Map is running with the multi-threading option on. Map currently
   supports the use of up to 2 processors. Based on the the user options and
   machine load, Map will use 2 processors during this run.
INFO:LIT:243 - Logical network io_button(3) has no load.
INFO:LIT:395 - The above info message is repeated 20 more times for the
   following (max. 5 shown):
   rst_n_IBUF,
   avr_rx_busy_IBUF,
   io_dip(23)_IBUF,
   io_dip(22)_IBUF,
   io_dip(21)_IBUF
   To see the details of these info messages, please use the -detail switch.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
INFO:Pack:1716 - Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range:
   0.000 to 85.000 Celsius)
INFO:Pack:1720 - Initializing voltage to 1.140 Volts. (default - Range: 1.140 to
   1.260 Volts)
